pkill -f streamlit
pkill -f "next dev"

# Restart
./deploy-stable.sh
```

### **If Audio Recording Fails**
- Check microphone permissions in System Preferences
- Ensure no other apps are using the microphone
- Try refreshing the browser page

### **If Models Won't Load**
- Check internet connection (models download on first use)
- Verify Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check logs in `logs/streamlit.log`
