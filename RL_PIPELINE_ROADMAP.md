# HumanVoiceAI: RL Pipeline Enhancement Roadmap

## 1. RL Environment Design

### State Space Definition
- **Input Processing Pipeline**
  - [ ] Implement speech-emotion recognition (SER) model integration
  - [ ] Add acoustic feature extraction (pitch, energy, MFCCs)
  - [ ] Develop context encoder for conversation history
  - [ ] Create speaker identification module

### Action Space
- **Discrete Actions**
  - [ ] Define emotion categories (happy, sad, neutral, etc.)
  - [ ] Add conversation management actions (e.g., "escalate to human")
  
- **Continuous Control**
  - [ ] Implement prosody parameter control (pitch, rate, energy)
  - [ ] Add emotion intensity modulation

### Episode Structure
- [ ] Design conversation turn-based episode boundaries
- [ ] Implement session timeout handling
- [ ] Add conversation state persistence

## 2. Reward Engineering

- [ ] Emotion alignment scoring
- [ ] Response appropriateness scoring

### Delayed Rewards
- [ ] User engagement metrics
- [ ] Conversation success scoring
- [ ] User feedback integration

### Reward Shaping
- [ ] Normalization pipeline
- [ ] Action penalty system
- [ ] Sparse-to-dense reward conversion

## 3. RL Agent Architecture

### Algorithm Selection
- [ ] Implement PPO baseline
- [ ] Add SAC for continuous control
- [ ] Integrate hierarchical RL for multi-level decision making

### Training Infrastructure
- [ ] Distributed training setup with Ray RLlib

### Pre-training & Fine-tuning
- [ ] Behavior cloning from human demonstrations
- [ ] Self-play environment
- [ ] Adversarial training for robustness

## 4. Technical Implementation

### Core Components
```python
class VoiceAIEnvironment(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self, ser_model, tts_engine, max_turns=10):
        self.ser_model = ser_model
        self.tts_engine = tts_engine
        self.max_turns = max_turns
        self.current_turn = 0
        self.conversation_history = []
        
    def reset(self):
        self.current_turn = 0
        self.conversation_history = []
        return self._get_state()
        
    def step(self, action):
        # Execute action and observe results
        # Calculate rewards
        # Update state
        pass
```
